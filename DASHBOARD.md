# Dashboard Update - Feb 1, 2026 (Evening)

**💰 Opportunity Shortlist**

*Opportunities with strong demand signals being tracked for potential Business Proposals*

1. **API Testing Tool Alternative (Postman Replacement)** 
   - **Demand Signal**: VERY STRONG — "Tired of Postman's workspace limits, rising prices, slow performance" / "Every other API-testing tool has evolved into bloated, cloud-first, subscription-based service"
   - **Pain Points**: Free tier limits (25 collection runs/month, 3 users, 1K API calls), slow with large collections, forced cloud sync, rising prices
   - **Competitors**: Bruno (open-source, Git-native, offline-first gaining traction), Testfully (SOC2/HIPAA compliant), Thunder Client (VS Code only), Insomnia (Kong-owned)
   - **Gap**: Developers want offline-first, Git-native, no vendor lock-in, unlimited local usage
   - **Pricing Evidence**: Postman alternatives article gets constant updates (5+ in 2026 alone), shows active market dissatisfaction
   - **Target**: Solo devs + small teams (2-10 people) frustrated with Postman pricing/limits
   - **MVP Scope**: Offline HTTP client, Git-native collections, environment variables, basic scripting, VS Code extension or Electron app
   - **Monetization**: Freemium (unlimited local) + paid team sync/collab features ($5-10/user/month), or one-time license
   - **🟢 STRONG CANDIDATE** — Clear pain, established alternatives proving demand, B2B SaaS model

2. **Self-Hosted VPN/Zero-Trust Coordinator**
   - **Demand Signal**: STRONG — "My concern was to be trapped with a $160m VC-funded company, when the inevitable rug gets pulled"
   - **Pain Points**: Headscale (Tailscale alternative) limitations: single coordinator = downtime during maintenance, no HA story, "mostly works but finicky"
   - **Gap**: HA-capable, easy-to-deploy zero-trust coordinator for teams avoiding vendor lock-in
   - **Target**: DevOps teams, self-hosters, privacy-conscious orgs
   - **Concern**: Niche market, complex infrastructure product
   - **🟡 MAYBE** — Strong anti-VC sentiment but narrower market

3. **Coding Agent Context Management Tool**
   - **Demand Signal**: MODERATE — "Default linear flow really frustrating... sometimes you flood/poison the context... Trees are the answer"
   - **Pain Points**: Linear chat context, can't preserve/reuse good context, hard to branch for experiments
   - **Gap**: Tree-based context management for coding agents (preserve branches, reuse contexts, side quests)
   - **Concern**: Emerging category, needs validation of standalone value vs. feature
   - **🟡 MAYBE** — Interesting problem but unclear if standalone product or just a feature
