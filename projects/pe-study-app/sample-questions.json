    "question": "What is the primary advantage of using a 4-20 mA current loop over a 0-10 V voltage signal for industrial instrumentation?",
    "options": {
      "A": "Lower power consumption",
      "B": "Immunity to voltage drops in long cable runs",
      "C": "Simpler wiring requirements",
      "D": "Higher signal resolution"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "4-20 mA current loops are preferred because current remains constant along the wire regardless of cable resistance or voltage drops. This makes them ideal for long cable runs in industrial environments where significant distances exist between sensors and control rooms.",

    "question": "A pressure transmitter has a calibrated range of 0-100 psi and outputs 4-20 mA. If the transmitter reads 65 psi, what is the expected output current?",

      "B": "13.6 mA",
      "C": "14.4 mA",
      "D": "15.2 mA"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "C",
    "explanation": "Using the formula: Output = 4 + (16 × (Reading/Span)). Output = 4 + (16 × (65/100)) = 4 + 10.4 = 14.4 mA. The span is 16 mA (20-4), and 65 psi is 65% of the 100 psi range.",

      "C": "Derivative (D)",
      "D": "All three equally"
    },
    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The Integral (I) term accumulates error over time and continues to adjust the output until the error reaches zero, thereby eliminating steady-state error. The P term reduces error but cannot eliminate it completely, and the D term responds to rate of change.",

      "C": "10",

    "correctAnswer": "B",
    "explanation": "The DC gain is found by evaluating G(s) at s=0: G(0) = 10/(0+2) = 10/2 = 5. This represents the steady-state gain of the system for a constant input.",

    "explanation": "Gain margin in dB = 20×log₁₀(1/|G|) where |G| is the loop gain at phase crossover. GM = 20×log₁₀(1/0.8) = 20×log₁₀(1.25) = 20×0.097 = 1.94 dB. A gain margin greater than 0 dB indicates stability.",

    },
    "correctAnswer": "D",
    "explanation": "The fail-safe position depends entirely on the process safety requirements. For example, in a reactor cooling system, you'd want fail-open to maximize cooling if air supply is lost. In a heating system, you might want fail-closed. Always analyze the safest state for the specific process.",
