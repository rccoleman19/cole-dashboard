## The 10 Rules

1. **Find expensive problems people already pay to solve** - Follow the money, not the hype
2. **Validate demand before building** - Real signups/payments > theoretical interest
3. **Monetization first, not later** - Know exactly how it makes money from day one
4. **Unit economics must work small** - If profit per customer doesn't work at 100 users, it won't work at 10,000
5. **Ship fast, kill fast** - Launch quick, set clear success metrics, pivot or kill if not hitting them
6. **Look for gaps, not just trends** - Find where demand exists but supply sucks
7. **Start narrow, dominate, then expand** - Own a niche before going broad
8. **Protect the data and credentials** - Encrypt sensitive stuff, don't hardcode passwords, log what matters
9. **Bias toward recurring revenue** - Subscriptions/SaaS > one-time sales
10. **Learn from every outcome** - Track what works, what doesn't, get better over time
