# 2026-01-31 Notes

## Discord Setup
- Discord now fully working ✅
- New bot token applied, server ID and user ID allowlisted
- Ryan's Discord user ID: 285947510722265088
- Server ID: 1466790153015005244
- Webhook URL confirmed working for posting

## GitHub Dashboard Plan
- Ryan's GitHub username: rccoleman19
- Need Personal Access Token (PAT) from Ryan to create repo
- Dashboard should be simple, easy to understand
- Will host via GitHub Pages (accessible from anywhere)
- Use Discord for communication, GitHub for dashboard

## Monetization Goals
- Primary goal: find ways to make money (apps, websites, games, inventions)
- Phase gate system to research → present → decide → build
- Secondary goal: tinkerer/inventor mindset — spot new invention opportunities
- Use Claude Pro models primarily (cost savings)
- Heavy token tasks after 6pm CST, before 8am CST (Ryan needs Claude during work day)
- OpenAI as fallback only if Claude limits hit

## ⚠️ MODEL FALLBACK ISSUE
- I get LOCKED UP / STUCK too quickly on the primary model
- Fallbacks are NOT triggering fast enough when this happens
- Ryan wants fallbacks to trigger MORE easily so I don't get stuck
- Need to research how to make fallback timeout/trigger faster
- This is a priority item for tonight's research

## Tonight's Task (assigned by Ryan)
- Research best ways for us to work together
- Suggest changes to anything (workflow, config, tools, etc.)
- Present findings to Ryan in the morning

## Isolated Browser
- Still not working (AppArmor/snap Chromium issues on EC2)
- Google Chrome installed but browser control service still unreachable
- Parked for now — not a priority currently

## Key Config Notes
- ⚠️ Do NOT modify gateway config unless absolutely necessary
- Gateway restart command is disabled (commands.restart not set to true)
- Primary model: anthropic/claude-opus-4-5
- Fallback: openai/gpt-4.1-mini
- Gemini also now available per Ryan
