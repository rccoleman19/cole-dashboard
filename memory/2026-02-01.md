## 8:00 PM - Opportunity Hunt (Cron Research Pass)

**Mission:** 30-minute research pass looking for revenue opportunities across HN, Reddit, Product Hunt.

**Key Finding: API Testing Tool Market (Postman Alternative)**

### Strong Demand Signals Found:
1. **HN Comment (Voiden thread):** "Every other API-testing tool has evolved into bloated, cloud-first, subscription-based service"
2. **Article headline:** "Tired of Postman's workspace limits, rising prices, slow performance"
3. **Show HN today:** Voiden (offline, Git-native API tool) — validates exact pain point

### Postman Pain Points (Validated):
- Free tier: 25 collection runs/month limit
- Team collaboration: 3 users max on free
- API calls: 1,000/month limit
- Slow performance with large collections
- Forced cloud sync
- Rising prices ($12-49/user/month for teams)

### What Developers Want:
- Offline-first (no account/cloud required)
- Git-native (collections as files)
- Unlimited local usage
- No vendor lock-in
- Fast performance

### Competitors Proving Demand:
- **Bruno**: Open-source, Git-native, gaining traction ("completely free, no paid plans")
- **Testfully**: SOC2/HIPAA compliant, Postman-compatible
- **Thunder Client**: 3M+ downloads as VS Code extension
- **Hoppscotch**: Lightweight browser-based
- **Insomnia**: Kong-owned, mature product

### Market Evidence:
- 5+ "Postman alternatives" comparison articles updated Jan 2026
- Shows active, ongoing dissatisfaction
- Multiple monetization models working (freemium, one-time license, team features)

### Business Opportunity:
**Target:** Solo devs + small teams (2-10 people) frustrated with Postman
**MVP Scope:** Offline HTTP client, Git-native collections, environment variables, basic scripting
**Monetization:** Freemium (unlimited local) + paid team sync ($5-10/user/month) OR one-time license
**Build Complexity:** Moderate (HTTP client, file-based storage, optional sync service)

### Assessment: 🟢 STRONG CANDIDATE
- Clear pain: ✅
- Proven demand: ✅ (multiple competitors succeeding)
- Monetization path: ✅ (B2B SaaS)
- Build feasibility: ✅ (moderate complexity)

## Other Opportunities Found:

### 2. Self-Hosted Zero-Trust VPN (Headscale Improvement)
- **Signal:** Strong
- **Quote:** "My concern: trapped with $160m VC-funded (Tailscale) company when rug gets pulled"
- **Pain:** Headscale has no HA story, single coordinator means downtime during maintenance
- **Gap:** HA-capable, easy-to-deploy coordinator
- **Assessment:** 🟡 Interesting but narrower market, more complex

### 3. Coding Agent Context Management
- **Signal:** Moderate
- **Pain:** "Default linear flow frustrating... flood/poison context... Trees are the answer"
- **Gap:** Tree-based context management for coding agents
- **Assessment:** 🟡 Unclear if standalone product or just a feature

## HN Trending (Feb 1, 8PM):
- Netbird (546 pts, 204 comments) — Zero-trust networking
- Coding agent article (284 pts, 120 comments) — Context management discussion
- Show HN: Voiden (18 pts) — Git-native API tool
- Adventure Game Studio (179 pts)
- FOSDEM 2026 recap (135 pts)

## Actions Taken:
1. ✅ Updated DASHBOARD.md with 3 opportunities to shortlist
2. ✅ Committed changes to local git repo (push failed - no remote configured)
3. ✅ Posted research findings to Discord #reports
4. ✅ Documented in daily memory

## Next Steps:
- **PRIORITY:** Draft Business Proposal for API Testing Tool if Ryan approves
- Need to decide: Build MVP or continue researching other opportunities?

---

## Technical Notes:
- Hit Brave Search API rate limit (1 req/sec on free plan, 5 total used)
- Switched to web_fetch to get HN, Product Hunt pages directly
- Reddit blocked fetch (403), Product Hunt blocked (403)
- Successfully fetched HN comment threads for analysis

## Lessons:
- Demand signals are stronger when you find direct quotes from users
- "Postman alternatives" is a well-established search query — shows sustained interest
- Multiple successful competitors = proof of demand, not a red flag
- API testing tools market is mature enough to have clear pain points but still actively evolving
