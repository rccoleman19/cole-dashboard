# Proposal Workflow

When you've researched an opportunity and think it's ready for my review, **don't ask me for permission to create the proposal. Just do it.**

## The Process

1. **You finish researching** an opportunity and believe it's worth proposing
2. **Create the single-page PDF proposal immediately**
3. **Update the dashboard** - move the opportunity to "Proposed" stage
4. **Notify me:** "New proposal ready: [Opportunity Name]. PDF is at [location]. Review when you have time."
5. **Wait for my response:** Approved, Rejected, or Questions

## Don't Ask

❌ "Want me to prepare a proposal?"

✅ **Just do it:** Prepare the proposal, tell me it's ready, and let me review on my schedule.

## My Response Options

- **Approved** → You move to build
- **Rejected** → You park it and move on
- **Questions** → I'll ask them

## Why This Works

This keeps things moving without back-and-forth. Your job is to surface opportunities - my job is to say yes or no.
